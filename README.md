Material Design WPF Youtube Downloader in C#

# How to use
You'll need an API key from our lovely friends at Google ( https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started )
Create a file called config.ini with this as an example: 
```
;config.ini
[GoogleAPI]
ApiKey = "APIKEY HERE WITH QUOTES"
ApplicationName = "APPLICATION NAME HERE WITH QUOTES"
```

And run, you're good to go!

# TODO
1. Quality selection.
2. Audio/Video selection.
3. ???
